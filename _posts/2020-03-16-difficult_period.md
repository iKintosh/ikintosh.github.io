# What I've been doing?

## Struggling 

The last month has been morally hard for me. I felt like everything is going down: my career and my education. I had no time to do anything I wanted and I didn't want to do anything I had to do.
I still don't know how that happened, but I guess it is because for the first time I faced the situation where I have been trying to finish a project at work for several months, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't do it. This project drained all my motivation.
But no matter how I like being miserable, I had to move forward. 
I noticed, when I don't want to do something, I procrastinate even more than usual. So I needed some system, that allows me to take control of my time. I started to follow [Bullet Journal method](https://bulletjournal.com/). Did it help me? I don't know about a long period, but for now yes. I'm able to finish my everyday tasks. I can go to work and do things there, so it is a miracle how a simple monitoring tool can motivate me _(I think that these things are individual)_. And I feel ready to set long-term goals. 

## Goals

To set goals I had to understand what I want to improve in my life. So I spent a whole evening trying to decode this mystery. However, the answer was simple, I'm absolutely happy with my relationship but absolutely unhappy with my professional skills. However, I have two time-consuming activities: work and study. So it is easier to connect the development of my skills to these activities. I may read work-related books and articles because as a data analyst I ought to. And doing homework can help me develop new professional skills. But to see this progress (of studying at work and gaining experience from the study) I have to develop a tool, that will help me notice this. Like this blog.
To sum up, to improve the professional skills I have to:

- read books and articles 
- learn new frameworks and apply them
- do pet projects _(don't know when)_
- write about my newly acquired skills and knowledge
- sleep well and move a little bit more

## Books 

In the meantime I started to listen to [audiobook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50147576) about goal achievement, I don't find it very deep or wise, but it motivates me and makes me think that I can achieve my goals. That's all I need right now. One of my goals is to write to this blog. And the other one to finish reading this [Docker book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36480186-docker). I will tell about it next time =)
